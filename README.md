# Bin-Packing-problem-exact-solution-python

## Problem description 
The bin packing problem (BPP) can be informally defined in a very simple way. We are given n items, each having an integer weight wj (j = 1, ..., n), and an unlimited number of identical bins of integer capacity c. The objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of bins so that the total weight packed in any bin does not exceed the capacity.
